# How does salt influence microbial communities?

Question:
1) How is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	- Null Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity will increase as salt concentration lowers.
		- Inverse relationship between richness and salinity.

2) How does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	- Null Hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater v salt water.
